Poly is a Go library and command line utility for engineering organisms.

* **Fast:** Poly is fast and scalable.

* **Modern:** Poly tackles issues that other libraries and utilities just don't. From general codon optimization and primer design to circular sequence hashing. All written in a language that was designed to be fast, scalable, and easy to develop in and maintain. Did we say it was fast?

* **Reproducible:** Poly is well tested and designed to be used in industrial, academic, and hobbyist settings. No more copy and pasting strings into random websites to process the data you need.

* **Ambitious:** Poly's goal is to be the most complete, open, and well used collection of computational synthetic biology tools ever assembled. If you like our dream and want to support us please star this repo, request a feature, or open a pull request.
