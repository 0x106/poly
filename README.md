# (Poly)merase
Poly is a Go library and command line utility for engineering organisms.

* **Fast:** Poly is implemented to be fast and scalable.

* **Modern:** Poly tackles issues that other libraries and utilities just don't. From general codon optimization and primer design to circular sequence hashing. All written in a language that was designed to be fast, scalable, and easy to develop in and maintain.

* **Reproducible:** Poly is well tested and designed to be used in industrial, academic, and hobbyist settings. No more copy and pasting strings into random websites to process the data you need.

* **Ambitious:** Our goal is to be the most complete, open, and well used collection of computational synthetic biology tools ever assembled.
